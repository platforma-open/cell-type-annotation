# Overview

Automatically annotates cell types in single-cell RNA sequencing data using pre-trained CellTypist models. This block takes normalized gene expression data as input and assigns cell type labels to individual cells based on learned gene expression patterns. As output it generates cell type annotations with confidence scores for each cell.
